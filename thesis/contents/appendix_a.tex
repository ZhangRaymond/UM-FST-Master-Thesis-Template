\chapter{APPENDIX SAMPLE}
Appendices may consist of material that is related to, but not appropriate for, inclusion in the text. They appear after the Bibliography or List of References and must be titled. They are listed, along with their titles, in the Table of Contents, not on a separate list of appendices. Pagination is continuous with the text, and the first page of each appendix is treated like the first page of a chapter in the text (i.e., counted, but not numbered).
